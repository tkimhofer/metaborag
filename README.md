# ⚗️ MetaboRAG: An AI Engine for Metabolomic Result Interpretation

## 🔍 What It Does
**MetaboRAG** is a prototype system that helps scientists interpret complex metabolomics data using **AI and curated biochemical knowledge**.

It connects changes in small molecules (metabolites) to **biological pathways**, **enzyme activities**, and possible **disease mechanisms** — by combining structured knowledge from public databases (like KEGG) with a powerful **large language model (LLM)**.

MetaboRAG can be thought of as an AI-driven metabolic pathway reasoning engine, designed to provide interpretable, context-rich, and biologically meaningful insights from metabolite expression data.

At its core, MetaboRAG uses a technique called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
- 🗃️ It retrieves relevant reactions and pathways from trusted molecular databases and curated knowledge bases.
- 🧠 A large language model (LLM) then integrates metabolite changes, highlights perturbed pathways, and generates clear biological interpretations.


## ⚙️ How It Works
1. You upload or enter a list of metabolites that are increased or decreased (e.g., experimental data).
2. The system:
   - Searches a **biochemical knowledge base**,
   - Finds relevant reactions that connect the metabolites,
   - Uses an **AI model** to explain what these patterns might mean — biologically and medically.

### Example
**Input**: ↑ Citrate, ↓ Succinate, ↑ Lactate  
**Output**: Possible TCA cycle blockage or mitochondrial dysfunction. May occur in sepsis or hypoxia.

## 🔬 Model Use 
MetaboRAG enables:
- the establishment and inference of mechanistic pathway models directly from experimental data, and
- the evaluation of existing hypotheses against up-to-date scientific literature and curated biochemical knowledge.

This dual approach helps both discover new pathway insights and validate current models to ensure biological relevance as knowledge advances.

## 🧪 What Makes It Different
- Combines **trusted biological data** (like KEGG pathways) with AI reasoning.
- Returns **interpretable explanations**, not just black-box scores.
- Can grow over time with new knowledge and disease associations.

## 💡 The Vision Behind MetaboRAG
The number of possible biochemical conversion reactions in human and other biological systems is immense, and the interconnectedness of metabolic pathways and their components is highly complex. As a result, interpreting metabolomics experiment results requires extensive domain knowledge and often considerable time.

The vision behind MetaboRAG is to combine trusted biochemical databases, controlled vocabularies, and ontologies with advanced AI methods like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This approach enhances the interpretation of metabolic data by linking raw measurements to meaningful biological insights faster and more accurately.

## 🚀 What's Next
Planned developments include:
- A real-time web app with upload support for metabolomics data.
- Context-sensitive interpretation of metabolic patterns across diverse experimental desings.
- Integration with analytical information such as from LC-MS and NMR settings.
- Continuous incorporation of relevant literature via PubMed.
