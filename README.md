# 🧬 MetaboRAG: An AI Engine for Metabolomic Result Interpretation

## 🔍 What It Does
**MetaboRAG** is a prototype system that helps scientists interpret complex metabolomics data using **AI and curated biochemical knowledge**.

It connects changes in small molecules (metabolites) to **biological pathways**, **enzyme activities**, and possible **disease mechanisms** — by combining structured knowledge from public databases (like KEGG) with a powerful **large language model (LLM)**.

MetaboRAG can be thought of as a retrieval-augmented, AI-driven metabolic pathway interpretation platform, designed to provide interpretable, context-rich, and biologically meaningful insights from metabolite data, grounded in the latest biochemical knowledge.

At its core, MetaboRAG uses a technique called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
- 🗃️ It retrieves relevant reactions and pathways from trusted molecular databases and curated knowledge bases.
- 🧠 A large language model (LLM) then integrates metabolite changes, highlights perturbed pathways, and generates clear biological interpretations.

This approach blends **hard-coded scientific findings** with **flexible AI reasoning**, enabling interpretable insights and not just black-box predictions.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. You upload or enter a list of metabolites that are increased or decreased (e.g., experimental data).
2. The system:
   - Searches a **biochemical knowledge base**,
   - Finds relevant reactions that connect the metabolites,
   - Uses an **AI model** to explain what these patterns might mean — biologically and medically.

### Example
**Input**: ↑ Citrate, ↓ Succinate, ↑ Lactate  
**Output**: Possible TCA cycle blockage or mitochondrial dysfunction. May occur in sepsis or hypoxia.

## 🔬 Model Use and Validation
MetaboRAG supports not only the **establishment of new biochemical and metabolic models**, but also enables researchers to **test and validate existing models** by comparing them against up-to-date scientific literature and curated biochemical knowledge. This helps ensure models stay current and biologically relevant as new discoveries emerge.

## 🧪 What Makes It Different
- Combines **trusted biological data** (like KEGG pathways) with AI reasoning.
- Returns **interpretable explanations**, not just black-box scores.
- Can grow over time with new knowledge and disease associations.

## 💡 The Vision Behind MetaboRAG
The number of biochemical conversion reactions in human and other biological systems is immense, and the interconnectedness of metabolic pathways and their components is highly complex. As a result, interpreting metabolomics experiment results requires extensive domain knowledge and often considerable time.

The vision behind MetaboRAG is to accelerate this process by leveraging AI, enabling faster and more accurate interpretation of metabolic data — transforming raw measurements into meaningful biological insights.


## 🚀 What's Next
Planned developments include:
- A real-time web app with upload support for metabolomics data.
- Integration with common analytical platforms such as LC-MS and NMR instruments.
- Clinical modules focusing on applications like sepsis and cancer metabolism.
- Continuous incorporation of relevant literature via PubMed.
